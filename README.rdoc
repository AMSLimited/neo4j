= Neo4j.rb

Neo4j.rb is a graph database for JRuby.


 
It provides:
* Mapping of ruby objects to nodes in networks rather than in tables.
* Dynamic, and schema-free - no need to declare nodes/properties/relationships in advance.
* Storage of ruby object to a file system.
* Fast traversal of relationships between nodes in a huge node space.
* Transaction with rollbacks support. 
* Indexing and querying of ruby objects.
* Migration and BatchInserter support
* Can be used instead of ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails or Merb
* Can be accessible as REST resources.

It uses two powerful and mature Java libraries:
* Neo4J (http://www.neo4j.org/) - for persistence and traversal of the graph
* Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html) for querying and indexing.
