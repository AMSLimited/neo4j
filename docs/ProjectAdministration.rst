We release new versions of the gem on the following schedule (if there has been deemed enough to warrent a release):

We try to follow `semver.org <http://semver.org/>`_ conventions, though we were finding that we were releasing things in patches and minor versions that shouldn't have gone out in those ways.  Having the release schedule is an attempt to relieve the pressure to get things out right away.  Knowing that minor and major release dates aren't too far in the future means that it won't take too long before our features are available to the world.
