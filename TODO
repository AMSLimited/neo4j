== TODO - soon

* Loading nodes that does not exist generated a stack dump.
* identity map - http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html
* the Neo4j::Node find method should use the Neo4j traversal if there are no lucene index available
* performance tests and check for memory leaks
* better documentation, use YARD instead of RDoc
* fix TODO's in the code
* Handle properties of type Array, Hash and Date

== TODO - maybe 
* handle corrupt lucene index after a crash.
* using two phase commit to make sure the lucene index is synchronized, not sure if we want this.
