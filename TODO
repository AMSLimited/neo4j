== TODO - soon

* sorting using lucene
* the Neo4j::Node find method should use the Neo4j traversal if there are no lucene index available* more tests on transactions and concurrency issues
* performance tests and check for memory leaks
* Better documentation, use YARD instead of RDoc
* Fix TODO's in the code

== TODO - later
* Handle corrupt lucene index after a crash.
* using two phase commit to make sure the lucene index is synchronized, not sure if we want this.
