== TODO - soon

* enable use of RAMDirectory to speed up lucene indexing - keep index in memory instead of on disk
* sorting using lucene
* add option to use the new lucene 2.4.0 InstantiatedIndex RAM-based index for faster indexing
* the Neo4j::Node find method should use the Neo4j traversal if there are no lucene index available* more tests on transactions and concurrency issues
* performance tests and check for memory leaks
* Better documentation, use YARD instead of RDoc
* Fix TODO's in the code

== TODO - later
* using two phase commit to make sure the lucene index is synchronized.
